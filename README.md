mudplus (a.k.a. MUD++)
=======
An open-source Groovy/Grails project under the GNU-Public lisence, with one slight exception:

Redistribution/use/code-alteration are all permissable, provided you leave any original header-comments in the files.
=======
Our Mission:

To modernize the experience of MUDing, that is, to provide a simple, maintainable, open-source, and FREE way of creating text-based games commonly known as MUDs.

Have you ever wanted to make your own web-based game but thought it too difficult to start? MUD++ provides you with the tools you need to leap into creating your own virtual world:

<ul>
  <li> MUD++ Driver
    <ul>
      <li> Modern Security: prevents common attacks against web sites, handles the tracking of User (a.k.a Soul) credentails, and provides fine-grained security policies at the member-level for what SecurityRole authorizations a Soul needs to run any particular code.</li>
      <li> Atomic Support Classes: designed with the idea in mind that each MUD is unique and your MudLib should be able to be largely unrestricted by driver concerns.</li>
      <li> Runtime, Community-Friendly, Sandboxed Development: with MUD++, we keep with the LPMUD tradition of allowing code to be created at runtime so that the server has no need to reboot with every change to the lib.</li>
      <li> Easy to use language parsing and run-time modifiable language rules/addition of verbs </li>
      <li> Tracking/State Storing (in JSON format) of game objects from dummies to carryables to weapons to npcs to souls.</li>
      <li> Support for your custom daemons (background processes) that allow your world to change with conditions you define, such as weather, time, seasons, area-specific events, etc.
      <li> Driver Functions that help you keep your main efforts geared toward world-building rather than code, without limiting the possibilities of your code </li>
      <li> Through-browser User Interface for runtime submission of code for creators </li>
      <li> Through-browser UI for common admin functions such as altering permissions, banning, logging, and analytics </li>
      <li> Use of modern scripting/OO language Groovy: easy to learn for those new to code, a certified Java language that those familiar with Java will love, succinct, intuitive, yet no compromising as far as functionality, and with several IDEs available ranging from Sublime Text Editor 2 (recommended for area-creators) to IntelliJ Ultimate Edition (recommended for power users) </li>
      <li> Cross-platform support and Ease of Deployment: any web-server capable of hosting a .WAR file is ready for MUD++ </li>
    </ul>
  <li>
